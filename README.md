### StudyWeb ###
Our web application is a learning aid for various tests and exams.
The user has the possibility to create a questionnaire, in which he can ask questions about any topic. He has the choice between single-choice-questions and questions which require an exact answer. 
The creator of the questionnaire also has the option of sharing it with other users, so his classmates also have the opportunity to learn from it. He can also give them authorization to edit his questionnaire.
Every user has the option of reviewing his learning progress.
